The configuration files in this folder are templates for components used to deploy jobs on the [Edinburgh Internation Data Facility's](https://edinburgh-international-data-facility.ed.ac.uk/) GPU cluster for the University of Edinburgh. These configuration templates should be somewhat useful for deploying jobs on any Kubernetes managed GPU cluster.
