# Background

The Edinburgh International Data Facilitiy (EIDF), is a god send. This data facility hosts Kubernetes managed GPU clusters which can be used to train robot learning policies. This guide is solely concerned with getting setup with EIDF and hence is mainly relevant for students at the University of Edinburgh and industry partners of EIDF. For details on more general Kubernetes configuration and job deployment please see other subsections of the Kubernetes section of these docs.
